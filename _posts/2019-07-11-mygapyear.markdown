With less than a year until I finish secondary education here in the UK, it feels like I have an impossibly short length of time to plan what to do afterwards. At the moment, I'm studying A levels in French, Spanish, and English at sixth form. After that, my plan is to take a gap year. It's a cliché dream to be young and want to travel the world, but it takes effort, courage, and just the right amount of stupidity to actually pull it off. Here's hoping I've got what it takes.

I thought I'd share updates on the planning process on my blog, partially so I could look back and remind myself how my ideas changed and how it all actually ended up coming together, and partially so anyone else with similar plans can see how much organisation and work it takes realistically. It's easy to get caught up in a world of bloggers and online influencers being paid to travel, but as I've quickly discovered, there's a lot more going on behind the scenes of the perfectly curated pictures you'll see on social media.

### The dream

I originally wanted to explore larger patches of the world taking flights and international train routes to all of my dream locations. As you can imagine, that idea fits neatly into a 17 year old's dreams, and not so neatly into a 17 year old's wallet. So there goes my dream of exploring Africa and South America when I hit 18. I got a part time job in fast food recently so I could start budgeting and then making more realistic plans based on the money I think I could make in the next year. I also happened to have the luck of having a friend at school who recently decided to take a year off to travel before university, and naturally we realised we could both save some money (and stay safer, for the sake of our parents and their sanity) by doing something together over the year of our dreams.

### The plan

It's impossible to have an Instagram account and not be at least a little inspired by all the #vanlife bloggers out there, and after making my travel account and posting holiday pictures, a couple of van dwelling instagrammers followed me. My friend and I spent hours going through van conversion tutorials and vlogs on YouTube, and after a surge of courage, we finally summoned up the stupidity to believe we could do it. That's not to say we can't, but there's just one vital thing missing. The effort.

### Turning the dream into a plan

The first thing we needed was a solid budget. We knew nothing we could do would get the year in the van to cost the pocket change we had, but with some work and support it's all possible. We worked out how much we could cut costs on, and how much we could handle while camping out in a vehicle for a year, and split the number in half. I talked to my parents, and after a lot of convincing, they agreed. Being unable to realistically raise enough money in just one year or get a job while living on the move during that year, we worked out how they could support me financially.

Of course, I hated the idea of being anything like the stereotype of a self righteous, spoiled kid who comes back to the country talking about how "enlightened" they feel after all of the hardships they faced living off their parents' money for a year. Instead, I took it back to the drawing board, cut even more out of the budget, and worked out how I could take a loan from my dad instead, to be fully repaid within a year after the end of the gap year. I set up a new bank account with savings pots dedicated to putting the wages from my new job towards the van to make good on my promise.

### Turning the plan into a reality

This is the part I'm stuck at now. With days until school ends and summer holidays begin, I've found myself with a lot more on my plate than I bargained for. All of my subjects have started the coursework units in the past week, I've started various writing projects that I don't want to neglect, and balancing creativity and productivity will definitely be a challenge. I'm feeling the pressure of having only this summer to make everything start to materialise so I don't overload myself with too much to do over the course of the academic year.

Still not sure if it'll be dumb luck or idiocy that gets me through, or perhaps just a little bit of that youthful naïveté. Looks like we'll just have to wait and see.
